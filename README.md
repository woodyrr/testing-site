Cool recipe website that uses the meal DB with a nice responsive user interface. It uses the mealdb api and googles firebase on the backend. This site provides auth and uses the firestore for data management. This was originaly for a front-end challenge on devChallenges.io, but I changed the original design a bit and connected a backend to it.
